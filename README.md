This is the code repository containing Javagruppens website.

The website is based on Jekyll, and is automatically re-generated / deployed by Github (Github Pages). Whenever a page is committed, a new build is produced and
deployed to [javagruppen.dk](http://javagruppen.dk). **Do** however notice that a cap of a maximum of 10 builds per hours does exist.

# Site contents

Here's a description of "what goes where", in regards to posts, pages etc.:

### Posts

** TO BE WRITTEN! **

### Pages

Pages must be placed in a sub-folder within the `pages`-folder, with an appropriate name. The file within that folder must then be named `index.md`, if the page contains 
one or more sub pages, these can be added to the same sub-folder, with a descriptive name.

The following example illustrates the layout for a **contact**-page, with **address**- and **form**-sub pages, eg.:

```
/pages
  /contact
    index.md
    address.md
    form.md
```

The [Front Matter](#terminology) of the pages "posts" can contain quite a few entries, to customize a few aspects of their appearance, these being√∏;:
  * `layout` controls the layout of the page in question (this **is required** normally this will be set to `page`, eg: `layout: page` - unless catering to special concerns)
  * `title` sets the title of the page (and **is required**)
  * `permalink` specifies the URL path to the page (this may be omitted, or must contain an URL path, eg.: `/example/` making it accessible on `http://javagruppen.dk/example/`)
  * `feature-img` sets the banner image on the page (containing the title of the page)
  * `tags` sets a list (array) of tags to categorize the page under (must be an array, eg.: `[Test, Eaxmple, Other]`)
  * `order` the sort order of the menu-item (linking to the page from the main navigation, must be an positive integer)
  * `hide` specifies if the page should appear in the main navigation (used for hiding sub-pages, eg.: `hide: true`)

### E-mails / "sent out" correspondence

Emails must be placed in the folder `_emails`, in the appropriate **year**-folder, and named on the form `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`, where `YYYY` is replaced with a 4
digits year, `MM` with a two digit month and `DD` with a two digit "day of month".  

Eg. a mail correspondence (newsletter) from April 1st 2018, must go into the `_emails/2018`-folder, and file must be named `2018-04-01-some-description.md` (where the description 
in this case is `some description`).

The [Front Matter](#terminology) of the e-mail "posts" must contain two entries:
  * `layout` controls the layout of the emails posts (and this **must** be set to email, eg: `layout: email`)
  * `subject` (being the subject line used in the e-mail)

# Terminology

| ------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
