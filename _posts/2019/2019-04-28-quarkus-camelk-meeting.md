####Speaker: Max Rydahl Andersen, Distinguished Engineer, Red Hat
Danish, living and working out of Switzerland as Red Hat Distinguished Engineer. 15+ year experience in developing professional open source.
Worked on Hibernate core & tools, lead JBoss Tools & Developer Studio, one of the architects behind OpenShift.io and
now core member of Quarkus.io focusing on its developer experience.

####Abstract:
Quarkus flips your assumption about how fast and small Java can be.
It gives you super fast start uptimes and small memory and disk footprint.
Perfect fit for usage in Cloud Native and Serverless applications.

Come to this talk to hear about an introduction to Quarkus, how it was
made, what it does and why it makes Java relevant again.

####Speaker: Claus Ibsen, Senior Principal Software Engineer, Red Hat
Works for Red Hat on the open source integration project Apache Camel. Author of Camel in Action books. Java Champion. ASF member. International speaker.


####Abstract:
Cloud-native applications of the future will consist of hybrid workloads: stateful applications, batch jobs, microservices, and functions, wrapped as Linux containers and deployed via Kubernetes on any cloud.

In this session, we will explore key challenges with function interactions and coordination, addressing these problems using Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIP) and modern approaches with the latest innovations from the Apache Camel community:

    Apache Camel 3
    Camel K
    Camel Quarkus

Apache Camel is the Swiss army knife of integration, and the most powerful integration framework. In this session you will hear about the latest features in the brand new 3rd generation.

Camel K, is a lightweight integration platform that enables Enterprise Integration Patterns to be used natively on any Kubernetes cluster. When used in combination with Knative, a framework that adds serverless building blocks to Kubernetes, and the subatomic execution environment of Quarkus, Camel K can mix serverless features such as auto-scaling, scaling to zero, and event-based communication with the outstanding integration capabilities of Apache Camel.

We will show how Camel K works. We'll also use examples to demonstrate how Camel K makes it easier to connect to cloud services or enterprise applications using some of the 300 components that Camel provides.
