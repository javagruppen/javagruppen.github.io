Dagsorden for JCafe med VirtusLab

Vi mødes hos Sopra Steria, Skindergade 45-47 · København

* 16.00 Arthur will talk about Green and Energy Efficiency in the JVM of 2024

Presented by Artur Skowroński

The purpose of this presentation is to introduce current initiatives, protocols, and tools that help application developers make their products more "green" and sustainable - all in the context of JVM.
In an era of increasing ecological awareness, the internal need to care for our planet, and (gulp) regulatory pressure, technology cannot (I'll remind you again of the regulatory pressure) lag.

If you don't want to go through a situation like GDPR again - I invite you to review what every programmer should know about current trends that will probably catch up with us all soon. I will also show practical ways of monitoring using JoularJX Java Agent, but also share the limitations and problems of existing solutions in practical implementation.


* 17.00 Annotation processor of 2024. Magical, cumbersome or a powerful tool?

Presented by Jacek Dubikowski

Even though annotation processing has been present in Java since 1.6, I noticed that the topic is esoteric for most of the Java world and only recently has gained some traction. Due to this fact, I would love to introduce it to you so you can add it to your toolbox.


* 18.00 En bid pizza
